### Project Topic

**Student Information System** - a web-application allowing managing student information in an educational institution

### Intended functionality

**User management:** The SIS provides administrators with tools to create, modify, and delete user accounts. Each account can be assigned one or more roles, such as student, lecturer, or administrator.

**Course management:** Administrators and lecturers can create, edit, and manage course offerings within the system. They can specify course details such as title, description and enrollment capacity.

**Enrollment management:** Administrators and lecturers can manage enrollment by approving or rejecting enrollment requests, adjusting course rosters, and generating enrollment reports.

**Gradebook:** Teachers have access to a gradebook feature where they can record and manage student grades for their courses. Students can view their grades through their accounts.
